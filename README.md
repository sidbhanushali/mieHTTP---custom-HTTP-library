# mieHTTP---custom-HTTP-library

Created a custom HTTP library to help me learn about HTTP requests. 3 different versions using ES 5 Prototype methods, Fetch API and promises, and async await. mieHTTP is as easy as pie.

Version 1:
    - ES 5 Prototype Methods 
  
Version 2: 
    -ES 6 Fetch API & Promises 
  
Version 3: 
    -ES 7/8 Async Await
